This is the famous Hangman game where you need to guess the word. you will start with 5 lives and depends on your guessing, with each mistake you will lose one life until you either win or lose ( hopefully not ! ). This project is a solo project done during my study in BeCode/Brussels which is totally based on OOP methodology

#### Installation

There is no actual installation for a game here, the only thing that is needed to run the game is at least **python 3** engine.

#### Usage

Simply by downloading the repo to your machine, via the terminal run the **main.py** and the game will commence.
